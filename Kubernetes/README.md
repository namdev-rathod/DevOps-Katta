### **Week 1: Basics of Kubernetes - Topics to Study**  

1. **What is Kubernetes?**  
2. **Key Features of Kubernetes** (Scalability, Self-healing, Automation).  
3. **Use Cases for Kubernetes** (e.g., Microservices, Batch Jobs, CI/CD pipelines).  
4. **Monolith vs. Microservices** (Differences and Kubernetes' role in microservices).  
5. **Kubernetes Architecture**:  
   - Master Node (Control Plane components: API Server, etcd, Scheduler, Controller Manager).

   - Interaction between Master and Worker Nodes.  
6. **Core Kubernetes Components**:  
   - Pods.  
   - Deployments.  
   - ReplicaSets.  
   - Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer).  
7. **Basic Commands using kubectl**:  
   - `kubectl get pods`, `kubectl create`, `kubectl delete`.  
8. **Kubernetes Cluster Setup**:  
   - Local setup with Minikube/Kind.  
   - Overview of managed services (EKS, AKS, GKE).  

This plan provides a solid foundation to start working with Kubernetes!
